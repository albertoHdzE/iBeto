# iBeto

A local-first conversational AI companion for Apple Silicon. Runs entirely on
your Mac against a local model served by LM Studio — no cloud, no API keys.

## Status

**Phase 1 + voice** — a usable streaming companion you can type or talk to:

- ✅ LM Studio backend (`chat` + `stream`)
- ✅ Interactive terminal chat with conversation history
- ✅ Persistent history — resume past conversations (`--resume`)
- ✅ Voice mode — push-to-talk speech in, spoken reply out (`--voice`)
- ✅ System prompt from a Markdown file
- ✅ Configurable model / URL / temperature via `configs/ibeto.toml`
- ✅ Optional latency + tokens/sec metrics (`--stats`)

Deliberately postponed (added later, one capability at a time): vision (iPhone
camera), tools/automation, semantic long-term memory.

## Requirements

- macOS + [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Python 3.12
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) running with its local server started
  (Developer tab) and a model loaded

## Quickstart

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh     # sync deps, verify LM Studio is reachable
./scripts/ibeto        # launch the chat  (add --stats for metrics)
```

Or directly: `uv run ibeto` / `uv run python -m ibeto`.

### Voice mode

```bash
uv run ibeto --voice
```

Push-to-talk: press Enter to start speaking, Enter again to stop. iBeto
transcribes with Whisper, replies in the terminal, and speaks the reply aloud.
Your iPhone 16 Pro works as the mic out of the box via Continuity. First run
downloads the Whisper model and macOS asks for microphone permission.

Type `exit` or press Ctrl-D to quit.

## Configuration

Everything tunable lives in `configs/ibeto.toml` — change the model there, not
in code. Default is `qwen3.5-4b-instruct-revised` (proven safe on a 16 GB M2;
9B+ models have frozen it). System prompts live in `ibeto/prompts/*.md`.

## Layout

```

  config/            TOML config loader
  prompts/           system prompts (Markdown) + loader
